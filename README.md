I just startet the reverse engineering and added only a few datasets. Currently it grabs voltage, cell voltage, current, packstatus and battery status. I will add more the next days.
And add some features like mqtt output as well.

This repository contains a reverse engineered part for reading serial data from battery management system from daly. 

It is based on the 3 byte communication protocol captures from Sinowealth Tool.

It is tested with the following devices:
* Dali Smart 4S 250A (chipset SH39F003)
